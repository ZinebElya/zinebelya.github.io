        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>In general, it is said that children follow in their parents' footsteps, but in my case, it's the
            opposite.
            I am following in the footsteps of my son who has ventured into programming.
            It's thanks to him that I made the decision to embark on a career change that aligns with my true
            passion.
            Coding has always fascinated me, and it was completely natural for me to explore this field.
        </p>
        <p>After a career in sales and marketing, I chose to pursue an intensive training program at BeCode.
            During this training, I had the opportunity to work with various programming languages such as
            JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, and Java.
        </p>
